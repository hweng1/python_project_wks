The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

The main idea of our project is to help Texas No-limit Holdâ€™em poker players track their performances across every game using processed data and graphs, so that they can have a better understanding of whether their certain playstyles could help them earn profit in the long run. We will explore how to source and collect data and create an analytic output based on the data input of the users. 
We made an excel table to showcase what is the data that we are storing and generating, which is our minimum viable product. The stretch goal of this project is to show the historical data in a barchart chart using Django.

Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
Our goal is to:
Learn how to process raw data with python. 
Explore how to use python to generate useful data output for users. 
Learn how to work together as a team using github and python studio and understand how data scientists work on projects. 
Learn how to use python as a backstage supporter for an easy-to-use web app

Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

We are going to first design a website to collect data input from users on poker game results, and then store these data in a database. 
Then we will design a series of functions in python as the functionalities of our web application. For example, the users can see the sum and their total profit or loss, and the trend of their profitability. We will also use the Django library to generate analytical graphs; for example, a bar chart in which the horizontal axis represents the time of the data input and the vertical axis represents the winning/losing performance. There could also be a horizontal line showing the sum of the data input


Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

We plan to meet twice each week as a team to work on this project. In our first meeting, we will discuss our progress, exchange thoughts, ideas and challenges; this meeting will be kept under 30 minutes and will most likely take place before or after our class session. In our second meeting, we will work on developing codes; this meeting will be longer (2-3 hours) and will take place over the weekend. 
Week1: Designing the web for user interface and selecting data needed
Week 2: Designing the database 
Week 3-6: Coding out the functions in python and linking to the website
Week 7-8: Testing and debugging the web application

Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
 
We plan to collaborate with each other using a collaborative repository. Since we will regularly have either virtual or offline meetings each week, we will split tasks during the meeting and each of us will contribute to the code individually after the meetings. Then we will check codes of each other during the next meeting to ensure potential problems and bugs are fixed before pushing to the main branch. Also if we have any problems outside meeting time we will communicate with each other through WeChat or Slack. We are choosing this flat organizational structure because we think this is the best way for everyone to communicate, have contribution, and potentially learn something from the project. 

Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

We think that storing data in an online database and calling the data from the database for analysis using Django in Python would be the most difficult task in our project since we have no previous experience of using Python as a backstage supporter for a website. We may potentially face many problems and bugs during the process. 

Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

Learning about website related tools like Flask and Django would help us better understand how to use this as a tool to help us analyze the data stored in the database.
Learning about how to store data to a cloud database,and call the data for analysis using Python or SQL language can also be helpful for our project. 
Learning about Python related data processing languages such as list() can also be helpful for us to analyze the data we have.
Learning about how to collaboratively use python and other softwares such as Tableau, SQL, and Excel can help us have a better understanding of what Python is capable of doing.
