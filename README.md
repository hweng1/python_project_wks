 repository for python team (Corinna, Michael, Wendi) project: Texas Hold'em Recorder Web Application 
 
We created this website to help poker players to document their gambling records and evaluate their own performance. For example, Michael can enter his winning and losing amount, numebr of big blinds won, and his total time played into the website and be able to easily visualize his record. There are currently apps on the market that help poker players record their history; however, these apps all have a freemium model. Once an user enters a certain amount of data, the app starts charging a fee. We want to create a free website for users to document their poker record and get better at playing poker. 

 First, the user will see a website page that asks him to log in to his account; he needs to put in his login ID and a password. If the user has previously created an ID on the website, then he will be able to log in. If the user has not previously created an ID on the website, then he will click the "register" button. Then the website will take him to a page and ask him to create an ID and a password. 

 After the user enters his page, he will see the results of his poker games. There will be a summary table that demonstrates his past records, including "win/loss", "total time played", "profit/loss per hour", and "big blind per hour." There will also be two bar chart graphs demonstrating the profit and loss of the player. 

 When the user needs to enter new record, he will click "click here to return to record a new session." The button will take him to a page that asks him to put in his record, which contains information previously mentioned in the summary table. 

 If the user wants to delete a session, then he can click "click here to delete a previous session" and it will take him to the result page. He can put in the id of the session that is indicated on the result page and that the user wishes to delete. 

 For future improvement:
 1. Allow each user to have his own session table. Currently all the users share the same session table, so one user could have session IDs like "2,10,13."
 2. Register a domain name and move the html pages, the database, and the programs online so that users can have access to his data anywhere at anytime.
 3. Build more data analytical function. 
 4. Allow the user to delete his account. 
 5. Conbine the functions of delete page and the result page
